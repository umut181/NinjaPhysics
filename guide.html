    <h2>What is Projectile Motion?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Projectile motion is the curved path an object follows when thrown or launched into the air, influenced by gravity.</p>
    <p>Some examples that you might relate to in daily life include a typical basketball shot, or the trajectory of an arrow.</p>
    <p>In our case, a ninja's shuriken flying toward its target is indeed a projectile motion.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>1. Velocity</h3>
    <p>Velocity is defined as displacement per unit time. A higher velocity means that the projectile will cover a larger distance in the same time interval.</p>
    <p>We can study the velocity vector in two components: Horizontal velocity and vertical velocity.</p>

    <h3>2. Angle</h3>
    <p>The angle between the initial velocity vector and ground, affects the height and distance a projectile can achieve. For example, a 45° angle maximizes range under normal conditions.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td> <img style="display: block; margin: 40px" src="trigonometryexample.jpg" alt="Velocity components breakdown" /></td>
            <td> <img style="display: block; margin: 40px" src="finalformula.png" alt="Velocity components breakdown" /> </td>
            <td> <img style="display: block; margin: 40px" src="breakdowncomponent.jpg" alt="Velocity components breakdown" /> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>


    <p style="text-align: center;">Here, we can see that velocity multipled by cos(angle) will give us the horizontal velocity.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Whereas in order to find the vertical velocity, we need to multiply the velocity by sin(angle).</p>

    <h3>3. Gravity</h3>
    <p> Gravity is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects toward its center.</p></p>
    <p> In the game, you will see that gravity pulls the shuriken downward, creating the curved trajectory that we see in projectile motion.</p>

    <h2>Game Controls</h2>
    <p>When it is your turn, an info panel will be displayed on your side, at the top of the screen.</p>
    <p>You will observe that there are <strong>sliders</strong> on these info panels, which you can adjust the <strong>velocity</strong> and <strong>angle</strong> of the shuriken.</p>
    <p>With the help of these sliders, you can experiment how these factors influence the path of your throw!</p>
    <p>After deciding the angle and velocity, all you have to do is click the <strong>throw</strong> button and watch the shuriken fly towards your enemy!</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Formulas</h2>
    <p>Here are some kinematics formulas for those of you who really want to be accurate with it.</p>
